						<h2>Welcome to your own treasure hunt in which you will find whatever you need while discovering our wonderful landmarks!</h2>
						<Strong> I'll tell you it's not going to be easy, but be sure, it's going to be FUN ! </strong>

						<h4> This will be a small breif of what's coming : </h4>
						<p> This treasure hunt consists on helping foreigners and tourists find whatever they need with a small glampse of creativity and brainwork. 
						<br> Now let's cut to the chase: In this treasure hunt you have to choose either to hide (Hiders!) or to seek (Seekers!)	
						, each one has it's own challenges. 
						<br> Hiders have to hide their own treasure (could be anything,anywhere, literally!) and create a riddle for the seekers to solve. In case they took something from the hiders treasure, they have to put something back in exchange.</p>
